The data sources used in this analysis require a subscription from Evolving Hockey.

If you want to run this script, you need the following data:

1) Standard skater data export for all seasons from 07-08 to 19-20 including the additional info

2) SPAR skater data export for all seasons from 07-08 to 19-20

If you replace the locations of those files in the code with their location on your local machine and ensure all dependencies are installed, the code should run.
